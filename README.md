## Basic Overview
This onboarding will help users to operate as Sirius Storage Director Node and/or Sirius Storage Replicator Node.

[Storage Director Node (SDN)](https://storagedocs.xpxsirius.io/docs/roles/owner/) acts as a front facing staging storage server for temporary hosting of files and doubles up as a transiting point for files to be stored in Replicators.  

A [Storage Replicator Node (SRN)](https://storagedocs.xpxsirius.io/docs/roles/replicator/) node has 2 roles:

1) replicator: store SDN data.
2) verifier: check the integrity of data is stored and safe.

To better understand how the Sirius Storage service works, it will be worthwhile reading the [online sirius storage documentation](https://storagedocs.xpxsirius.io/)
